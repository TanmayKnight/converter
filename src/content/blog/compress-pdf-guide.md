We've all been there: you try to upload a resume or send a report via email, and you get the dreaded error message: **"File is too large"**.

Most email providers (Gmail, Outlook) limit attachments to 25MB. If your PDF contains high-resolution scans or images, it can easily exceed this.

## Why are PDFs so big?

PDFs are "container" formats. They hold text, fonts, vector graphics, and—the main culprit—**images**.
When you save a document as a PDF, it often keeps images at their original, print-ready resolution (e.g., 300 DPI). For a screen-viewable file, this is unnecessary.

## How PDF Compression Works

Compression works by:
1.  **Downsampling Images**: Reducing the resolution of images to 72 DPI (standard screen resolution).
2.  **Removing Redundancy**: Stripping out unused fonts and metadata.
3.  **Optimization**: Using efficient encoding algorithms.

## How to Compress with UnitMaster

Our compression tool offers a smart balance between size and quality.

1.  **Safety First**: Since we process locally, your confidential data stays with you.
2.  **Drag & Drop**: Upload your heavy file.
3.  **Smart Compress**: Our algorithms analyze the file structure and discard unnecessary bits.
4.  **Download**: Get a file that is often 50-80% smaller than the original.

*Tip: If your PDF is mainly text, compression might not reduce it much. It works best on files with photos/scans.*
