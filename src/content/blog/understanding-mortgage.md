When you take out a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, your monthly payment remains the same for decades. However, the **composition** of that payment changes drastically over time. This process is called **Amortization**.

## The Early Years: Interest Heavy

In the beginning of your loan, you owe the bank a lot of money (the "Principal"). Therefore, the interest charge is high.
For a $500,000 loan at 7% interest:
*   **Year 1**: You might pay $40,000 total, but $34,000 of that is just interest! Only $6,000 goes toward paying off the house (Principal).

## The Tipping Point

As you chip away at the principal, you owe less interest each month.
Usually around **Year 15-18** of a 30-year loan, you reach the "tipping point" where more of your payment goes toward Principal than Interest.

## How Extra Payments Help

Since interest is calculated based on the *current* balance, making even one extra payment early on can save you thousands.
*   Paying **$100 extra month** goes 100% toward Principal.
*   This lowers the balance immediately, reducing the interest charged next month, and every month thereafter for 30 years.
