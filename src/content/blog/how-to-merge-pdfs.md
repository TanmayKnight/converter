Combining PDF files is one of the most common administrative tasks, yet most operating systems don't make it obvious how to do it. While Adobe Acrobat comes with a hefty subscription fee, UnitMaster allows you to do it for free, directly in your browser.

## Why Merge PDFs?

1.  **Organization**: Keep related documents (invoices, receipts, contracts) in a single file.
2.  **Sharing**: Send one attachment instead of five separate emails.
3.  **Portfolios**: Combine your resume, cover letter, and work samples.

## The UnitMaster Way (Private & Secure)

Most "Free PDF Mergers" upload your files to their backend servers to process them. This creates a privacy risk for sensitive documents like bank statements or legal contracts.

**UnitMaster is different.** We use a technology called WebAssembly to run the PDF processing engine _inside your web browser_.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Go to the Tool**: Open our [PDF Merger](/tools/pdf/merge).
2.  **Select Files**: Drag and drop your PDF files. You can select multiple files at once.
3.  **Reorder**: Need the cover page first? Simply drag and drop the thumbnails to rearrange the page order.
4.  **Merge**: Click "Merge PDF". The browser will instantly combine the bytestreams and generate a new file.
5.  **Download**: Save your new document.

## Alternative Methods

### On macOS (Preview)
1. Open the first PDF in Preview.
2. Enable "Thumbnails" view.
3. Drag the second PDF file _into_ the thumbnail sidebar.
4. Save.

### On Windows
Windows 10/11 doesn't have a built-in PDF merger. You would typically need to download software. UnitMaster saves you this installation step by running in Edge or Chrome.
